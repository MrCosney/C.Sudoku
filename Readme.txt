Hello, Evaluator! 

I hope you enjoy this "vacation" ;) Here is a 2 version of sudoku solver.

a) Sudoku - solves sudoku as it should do.

b) BonusSudoku - do the same thing but with few options.

	1) Color sudoku in various colors:
		-red    (Colors in Red)
		-grn	(Colors in Green)
		-blu	(Colors in Blue)
		-yel	(Colors in Yellow)
	2) Save solved sudoku into the .txt file:
		-w

You can use Options at the begining and in the end of file.
Example : 
./sudoku -red "9...7...." "2...9..53"  ...
same as 
./sudoku "9...7...." "2...9..53"  ... -red

 
P.s Combination of Options do not supported yet ;)
